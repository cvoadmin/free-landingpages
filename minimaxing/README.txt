Minimaxing




The very first responsive site template I ever made on 5grid (then skelJS, then Skel,
and finally Responsive Tools). It's clean, minimal, and so generic you can use it for
pretty much anything.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
